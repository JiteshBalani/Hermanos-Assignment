# Hermanos-Assignment
This is a Assignment Project I did for the company "Hermanos" located in Thane, Maharashtra, India

This project is prepared with HTML, CSS(without the use of Framework) and vanilla Javascript

The Project was prepared under very strict deadline and as the result it is incomplete in some aspects.

Features:
1. Page Loader
2. Lazy Loader for all the Images
3. Navbar Components have respective routes.
4. Dummy Images and content is given wherever required.

Features Not Prepared:
  1. Owl Carousel
  2. Responsive Design for Mobile Devices
  3. Form actions and link to Database.

Hosting: Netlify

Some of the components in footer are also not prepared because of time restrictions and Power cuts in afternoon.

Learnings
1. Got to make a good single page webpage with a variety of content.
2. Got to know my capacity to perform in pressure.
3. Got to learn new things in Javascript and CSS properties.

Thanks Hermanos | Ideamagix
